# Tricorder

Written a few years ago, this is a Python script for monitoring a specific log file.

* Parses a log file and keep a running mean of three processes that are stored in a pickle file and database.
* Designed to work only on a certain log file, but could be modified for others.

Any improvement suggestions are welcome.
